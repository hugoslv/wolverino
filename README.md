# Wolverino
Muscle-controlled fully automatic DiY X-Men Wolverine claws that
deploy and retract using Electromyography (EMG) or Mechanomyography (MMG)
signals.

## What we've used for our builds
Between (a lot of) 3D printed parts, textiles, hardware and other
tools its best to give this checkist prior to strating your build.

### Tools
[ ] 3D printer

[ ] Super glue

[ ] Small pliers

[ ] Sewing machine

[ ] Soldering iron

[ ] Solder

### Textile 
[ ] 100 cm of elastic strip (2.5 cm width)

[ ] 21 cm of velcro loop tape (2 cm width)

[ ] 10 cm of velcro hook tape (2 cm width)

[ ] 2 adjustable buckles (2.5 cm running space)

### Hardware
[ ] Power bank with on/off button ([this
model](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/power-banks/7757504/)) works
great)

[ ] USB to Micro (or Mini) USB cable ([retractable is
recommended](http://www.dx.com/pt/p/retractable-usb-to-mini-usb-data-cable-74cm-length-22552#.WYMNZhRT7Ew))

[ ] Metal wire (like the one used for hanging picture frames)

[ ] Small nail

#### Arduino variant
[ ] Arduino Nano (or equivalent)

[ ] [TowerPro SG90 Micro
Servo](http://www.dx.com/pt/p/towerpro-sg90-9g-mini-servo-with-accessories-12859?tc=EUR&gclid=EAIaIQobChMImq_ws_y61QIV1kAbCh2QWAYLEAQYAiABEgKSEfD_BwE#.WYMKfRRT7Ew)

[ ] [Force Sensitive Resitor
(FSR)](http://www.botnroll.com/en/outros/222-sen-09375-sensor-de-forca-resistivo-05-.html?search_query=fsr&results=3)
sensor with 1.3 cm diameter

[ ] Header pins


## Acknowledgments:
This project started out at at [Pixels
Camp](https://github.com/PixelsCamp) 2016 as a friends hangout between
[hugoslv](https://github.com/hugoslv),
[3devangelist](https://github.com/3devangelist) and 
[@pires](https://github.com/pires), where it won 2nd place. 

Subsequent developments made to create a lower-cost version (based on
the Arduino and FSR sensors) have been partially supported by the
Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Setúbal (EST) from Instituto
Polit&eacute;cnico de Setúbal (EST) under the project "Garra".
